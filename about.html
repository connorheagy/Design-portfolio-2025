                    <p class="p0">Hello, I'm Connor.</p> 
                    <p class="p1">I'm a designer and developer passionate about crafting digital experiences that are intuitive, 
                        visually refined, and empathetic. I thrive at the intersection of aesthetics and logic, blending artistic 
                        vision with technical precision to solve real-world problems through design.
                        I am currently pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Studio Art at Grinnell College (Class of '26), 
                        and I bring a multidisciplinary approach to UX/UI design. My process is rooted in research, critique, and iteration.
                    </p>
                        

                    <p class="p2">My journey began with a love for drawing, which led to winning the Doodle for Google competition in 
                        2014 as Indiana's state finalist, an experience that first connected me to the world of design and technology. 
                        Since then, I've continued exploring creative mediums including graphic design, web design, and fine arts.
                        In 2022, I was honored to win the Teen Mural Competition hosted by the Carmel Clay Public Library, where my design 
                        was selected as the centerpiece of their 30-foot mural for a major renovation project. With over 103,000 community members served, 
                        this recognition marked a meaningful milestone in my evolution as creative problem-solver.
                        Whether I'm building interfaces, refining layouts, or animating interactions, 
                        I'm committed to creating work that is both stunning and purposeful.
                    </p>
