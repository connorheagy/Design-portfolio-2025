                    I listen to alot of music, but most of the time I struggle to find anthing new that I 
                    truly enjoy. After endless hours of scouring random reddit forums and Spotify playlists, 
                    I came up with Echo. At its core, Echo is a music discovery social media app. Echo allows you to post 
                    songs that are you are excited about. You can discuss your niche interests in joinable groups that matches your 
                    music taste. Echo allows avid music listens to immerse themselves within curated communities. The user interface amplifies
                    the meaning of connection by reducing visual clutter and emphasizing user interaction. Simplifying how we find music, 
                    Echo centralizes the task by bringing people together.

                                <p>User interview sessions were conducted during the needfinding phase. This consisted of
                                    relevent questions regards user interaction within the context of competitive apps (e.g Spotify). 
                                    Additionally, participants were given a number of tasks on the platform and observations were recorded 
                                    for further refinement. Upon compiling quantitative user data, generalized personas were created for 
                                    accurate implimentation of the product.
